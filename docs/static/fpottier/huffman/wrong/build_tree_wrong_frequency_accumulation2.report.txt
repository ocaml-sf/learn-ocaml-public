Question 1
  Found [build_alphabet] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [build_alphabet] seems correct.
Question 2
  Found [build_alphabet] with compatible type.
  Found [build_tree] with compatible type.
  Failure: [build_tree] is incorrect.
    The following expression:
    
     | "badc" |> build_alphabet |> build_tree
    yields the following tree, which is suboptimal:
    
     | Node (Leaf 'd', Node (Leaf 'a', Node (Leaf 'c', Leaf 'b')))
    According to this tree, the input text "badc" is encoded as the binary
    string 111100110, whose length is 9 bits, whereas, by using another tree,
    this input text can be encoded as a binary string of only 8 bits.
Question 3
  Failure: Cannot find  [build_encoding_dictionary]
Question 4
  Failure: Cannot find  [find]
Question 5
  Failure: Cannot find  [write]
Question 6
  Failure: Cannot find  [compress]
