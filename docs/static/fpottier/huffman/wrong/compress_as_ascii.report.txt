Question 6
  Found [compress] with compatible type.
  Found [decompress] with compatible type.
  Failure: Something is wrong. The following expression:
    
     | "It is amazing that such a seemingly short sentence can be successfully compressed."
     | |> compress
    produces a sequence of 656 bits, whereas the original sentence occupies
    656 bits when represented as an ASCII string. No compression has been
    achieved! Perhaps your binary encoding of the dictionary is not compact
    enough?
