Question 1
  Found [build_alphabet] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [build_alphabet] seems correct.
Question 2
  Found [build_alphabet] with compatible type.
  Found [build_tree] with compatible type.
  Failure: [build_tree] is incorrect.
    The following expression:
    
     | "aaaabbbccd" |> build_alphabet |> build_tree
    yields the following tree, which is suboptimal:
    
     | Node (Node (Leaf 'd', Leaf 'c'), Node (Leaf 'b', Leaf 'a'))
    According to this tree, the input text "aaaabbbccd" is encoded as the
    binary string 11111111101010010100, whose length is 20 bits, whereas, by
    using another tree, this input text can be encoded as a binary string of
    only 19 bits.
Question 3
  Failure: Cannot find  [build_encoding_dictionary]
Question 4
  Failure: Cannot find  [find]
Question 5
  Failure: Cannot find  [write]
Question 6
  Failure: Cannot find  [compress]
