Question 1
  Found [return] with compatible type.
  Found [>>=] with compatible type.
  Found [fail] with compatible type.
  Found [choose] with compatible type.
  Found [sols] with compatible type.
  Functional correctness
    Success 1: The code seems correct. Tested 2411 scenarios.
  Laziness
    Success 1: The code seems lazy.
Question 2
  Found [return] with compatible type.
  Found [>>=] with compatible type.
  Found [fail] with compatible type.
  Found [choose] with compatible type.
  Found [sols] with compatible type.
  Found [at_most_once] with compatible type.
  Functional correctness
    Success 1: The code seems correct. Tested 2486 scenarios.
  Laziness
    Failure: Some computations take place too early. The following
             expression:
      
       | Seq.map snapshot sols (
       |   choose (tick (return 0)) (at_most_once (tick (return 0)))
       | )
       | |> Seq.take 20
       | |> Seq.to_list
      produces the following result: [[((* value: *) 0, (* work: *) 2); ((*
      value: *) 0, (* work: *) 2)]] This is invalid. Producing the following
      result is valid: [[((* value: *) 0, (* work: *) 1); ((* value: *) 0, (*
      work: *) 2)]]
