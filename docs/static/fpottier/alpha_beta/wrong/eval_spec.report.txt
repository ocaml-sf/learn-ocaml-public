Question 1
  Found [size] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [size] seems correct.
Question 2
  Found [height] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [height] seems correct.
Question 3
  Found [eval] with compatible type.
  Failure: [eval] is incorrect.
    The following expression:
    
     | eval Even (nonleaf [nonleaf [leaf (-1)]])
    produces the following result: [-max_int] This is invalid. Producing the
    following result is valid: [-1]
  Found [eval] with compatible type.
  Failure: [eval] is not symmetric. This expression:
    
     | let sense = Even in
     | let t = nonleaf [leaf (-1)] in
     | eval (opposite sense) t
    should be equivalent to the following expression:
    
     | let sense = Even in
     | let t = nonleaf [leaf (-1)] in
     | - (eval sense t)
    Yet, the former expression produces the following result: [-max_int]
    whereas the latter expression produces the following result: [-1]
Question 4
  Failure: Cannot find  [nval]
  Found [eval] with compatible type.
  Failure: Cannot find  [nval]
Question 5
  Failure: Cannot find  [ntval]
Question 6
  Failure: Cannot find  [bval]
  Failure: Cannot find  [bval]
Question 7
  Failure: Cannot find  [assured_win]
Question 8
  Failure: Cannot find  [bmove]
