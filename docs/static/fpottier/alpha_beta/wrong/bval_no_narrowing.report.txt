  Found [bval] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [bval] seems correct.
  Found [bval] with compatible type.
  Failure: [bval] appears to examine more tree nodes than required. The
           following expression:
    
     | let t = nonleaf [leaf 1; leaf 0; nonleaf [leaf 0; leaf 0]; leaf 1] in
     | let alpha = -1 in
     | let beta = 1 in
     | bval alpha beta t
    evaluates 7 tree nodes, whereas evaluating 6 nodes is sufficient.
