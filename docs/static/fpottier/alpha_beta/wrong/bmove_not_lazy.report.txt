Question 6
  Found [bval] with compatible type.
  Found [ntval] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [bval bottom top] appears to respect its specification.
  Found [bval] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [bval] seems correct.

Question 7
  Found [assured_win] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [assured_win] seems correct.
  Found [assured_win] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [assured_win] appears to examine as few tree nodes as possible.
Question 8
  Found [bmove] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [bmove] seems correct.
  Found [bmove] with compatible type.
  Failure: [bmove] appears to examine more tree nodes than required. The
           following expression:
    
     | let t = nonleaf [leaf (-1)] in
     | let alpha = -1 in
     | let beta = 0 in
     | bmove alpha beta t
    evaluates 3 tree nodes, whereas evaluating 2 nodes is sufficient.
