Question 6
  Found [sigma] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [sigma] seems correct.
Question 7
  Found [split_weight] with compatible type.
  Failure: [split_weight] is incorrect.
    When applied to the following arguments:
    
     | 0
    
     | (fun w1 w2 -> 1 + w1 * w2)
    it produces the following invalid result:
    [0] A valid result is:
    
     | 1
