Question 2
  Found [return] with compatible type.
  Found [>>=] with compatible type.
  Found [fail] with compatible type.
  Found [choose] with compatible type.
  Found [sols] with compatible type.
  Found [at_most_once] with compatible type.
  Functional correctness
    Failure: Something is wrong. The following expression:
      
       | sols (at_most_once (return 0)) |> Seq.take 20 |> Seq.to_list
      produces the following result: [[0; 0]] This is invalid. Producing the
      following result is valid: [[0]]
