Question 1
  Found [const] with compatible type.
  Found [conn] with compatible type.
  Found [neg] with compatible type.
  Found [var] with compatible type.
  Failure: Something is wrong. The following expression:
    
     | conn false (const false) (const false)
    produces the following result: [FConn (false, FConst (false), FConst
    (false))] This is invalid. Producing the following result is valid:
    [FConst (false)]
