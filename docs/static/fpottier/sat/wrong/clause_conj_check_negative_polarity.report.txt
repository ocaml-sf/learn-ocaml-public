Question 4
  Failure: Something is wrong. Consider this formula:
    
     | FConn (false, FVar (0), FNeg (FConn (false, FVar (0), FVar (0))))
    This formula can also be displayed as follows:
    
     | x0 | ~(x0 | x0)
    While attempting to convert this formula to conjunctive normal form, the
    following exception was raised: ["Assert_failure ./solution.ml:150:8"]
