Question 1
  Found [const] with compatible type.
  Found [conn] with compatible type.
  Found [neg] with compatible type.
  Found [var] with compatible type.
  Success 1: The smart constructors seem correct.
Question 2
  Found [eval] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [eval] seems correct.
Question 3
  Found [satisfiable] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [satisfiable] seems correct.
  Found [valid] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [valid] seems correct.
Question 4
  Success 1: [CNF] seems correct.
Question 5
  Found [intersect] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [intersect] seems correct.
Question 6
  Success 1: [Trail] seems correct.
Question 7
  Success 1: [VarSet] seems correct.
Question 8
  Failure: Something is wrong. Consider this formula (of 3 variables):
    
     | FConn (false, FNeg (FVar (0)), FNeg (FVar (0)))
    This formula can also be displayed as follows:
    
     | ~x0 | ~x0
    Your solver claims that this formula is satisfied by the following
    assignment:
    
     | x0 & x1 & x2
    However, this is not the case. Under this assignment, this formula
    evaluates to false.
