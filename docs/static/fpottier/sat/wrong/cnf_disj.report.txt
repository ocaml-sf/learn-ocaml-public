Question 1
  Found [const] with compatible type.
  Found [conn] with compatible type.
  Found [neg] with compatible type.
  Found [var] with compatible type.
  Success 1: The smart constructors seem correct.
Question 2
  Found [eval] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [eval] seems correct.
Question 3
  Found [satisfiable] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [satisfiable] seems correct.
  Found [valid] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [valid] seems correct.
Question 4
  Failure: Something is wrong. Consider this formula (of 0 variable):
    
     | FConst (false)
    This formula can also be displayed as follows:
    
     | false
    Converting this formula to conjunctive normal form yields the following
    new formula (of 0 variable):
    
     | FConst (true)
    This formula can also be displayed as follows:
    
     | true
    Unfortunately, these formulae do not have the desired relationship. The
    original formula is not satisfied by this assignment:
    
     | 
    whereas the new formula is satisfied by this extended assignment:
    
     |
