Question 1
  Found [const] with compatible type.
  Found [conn] with compatible type.
  Found [neg] with compatible type.
  Found [var] with compatible type.
  Success 1: The smart constructors seem correct.
Question 2
  Found [eval] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [eval] seems correct.
Question 3
  Found [satisfiable] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [satisfiable] seems correct.
  Found [valid] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [valid] seems correct.
Question 4
  Failure: Something is wrong. Consider this formula (of 1 variable):
    
     | FConn (false, FVar (0), FNeg (FConn (false, FVar (0), FVar (0))))
    This formula can also be displayed as follows:
    
     | x0 | ~(x0 | x0)
    Converting this formula to conjunctive normal form yields the following
    new formula (of 2 variables):
    
     | FVar (0)
    This formula can also be displayed as follows:
    
     | x0
    Unfortunately, these formulae do not have the desired relationship. The
    original formula is satisfied by this assignment:
    
     | ~x0
    whereas the new formula is not satisfied by any extension of this
    assignment.
