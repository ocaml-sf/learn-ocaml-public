Question 6
  Failure: Something is wrong. Executing the following instruction sequence:
     | let module Trail = Trail() in
     | let s = ref (-1) in
     | (* Take a checkpoint. *)
     | let checkpoint0 = Trail.record() in
     | (* Set [s] to 0 and push an undo action. *)
     | let x = !s in s := 0; Trail.push (fun () -> s := x);
     | (* Go back to this checkpoint. *)
     | Trail.revert checkpoint0;
     | (* Check the value of [s]. *)
     | if -1 <> !s then raise (ExpectedGot (-1, !s));
     | ()caused the following exception to be raised: [ExpectedGot(-1, 0)]
