Question 4 (iteration)
  Found [foreach] with compatible type.
  Failure: Something is wrong. The following expression:
    
     | elements
     |   (
     |     map (fun (x, y) -> x - y)
     |       (
     |         product
     |           (sum (singleton 0) (singleton 0))
     |           (sum (singleton 0) (singleton 1))
     |       )
     |   )
    produces the following value: [[0; 0; -1; -1]] Yet, it should produce
    this value: [[0; -1; 0; -1]]
