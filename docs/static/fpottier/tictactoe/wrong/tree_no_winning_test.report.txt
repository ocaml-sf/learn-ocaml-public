  Failure: Something is wrong. The following expression produces an incorrect
           subtree:
    
     | let w = 1 in
     | let h = 1 in
     | let k = 1 in
     | let t = tree (initial w h k) in
     | let path = [encode w h 0 0] in
     | descendant path t
    A leaf of value -1 is expected, yet a leaf of value 0 is found.
