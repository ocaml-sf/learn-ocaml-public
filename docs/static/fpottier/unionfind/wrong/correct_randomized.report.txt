Question 1
  Found [make] with compatible type.
  Found [find] with compatible type.
  Found [eq] with compatible type.
  Found [union] with compatible type.
  Success 1: The code seems correct. Tested 9486 scenarios.
Question 2
  Found [make] with compatible type.
  Found [find] with compatible type.
  Found [eq] with compatible type.
  Found [union] with compatible type.
  Failure: The computational complexity of the code seems too high. For a
           certain scenario (not shown), which involves 511 union operations
           and 4096 find operations, your candidate implementation performs
           41982 reads of references, whereas our solution performs only 9609
           reads.
