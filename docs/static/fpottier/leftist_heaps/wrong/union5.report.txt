Question 1
  Found [rank] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [rank] seems correct.
Question 2
  Found [makeT] with compatible type.
  Success 1: The heap invariant seems respected.
  Success 1: The rank invariant seems respected.
  Success 1: The leftist invariant seems respected.
  Success 1: The multiset of elements seems preserved.
Question 3
  Found [singleton] with compatible type.
  Success 1: [singleton] seems correct.
Question 4
  Found [makeT] with compatible type.
  Found [union] with compatible type.
  Success 1: The heap invariant seems respected.
  Success 1: The multiset of elements seems preserved.
  Failure: The complexity of union seems incorrect.
    The following expression:
    
     | union (
     |   makeT Red (
     |     makeT Red (
     |       makeT Red (makeT Red E E) (
     |         makeT Red E E
     |       )
     |     ) (makeT Red E E)
     |   ) (makeT Red E E)
     | ) (makeT Red E E)
    causes 4 priority comparisons, while we estimate that 3 comparisons
    should suffice.
