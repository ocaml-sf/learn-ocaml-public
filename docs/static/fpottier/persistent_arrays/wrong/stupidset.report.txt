Correctness
  Found [make] with compatible type.
  Found [get] with compatible type.
  Found [set] with compatible type.
  Success 1: The code seems correct. It passes 5702 test scenarios.
Optimization
  Found [make] with compatible type.
  Found [get] with compatible type.
  Found [set] with compatible type.
  Success 1: The code seems to respect the optimization scheme of Question 4.
Complexity
  Found [make] with compatible type.
  Found [get] with compatible type.
  Found [set] with compatible type.
  Failure: The desired complexity is not achieved. In the following scenario:
    
     | let a = make 1 false;;
     | let b = set a 0 true;;The last call involves 1 uses of dereferencing
                             (!), whereas 0 uses should be enough.
