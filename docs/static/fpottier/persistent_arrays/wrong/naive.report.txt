  Success 1: The code seems correct. It passes 5702 test scenarios.
Optimization
  Found [make] with compatible type.
  Found [get] with compatible type.
  Found [set] with compatible type.
  Failure: The optimization scheme of Question 4 is not respected. At the end
           of the following scenario:
    
     | let a = make 1 false;;
     | let b = set a 0 true;;
     | let observed = get b 0;;The graph should have a path from [b] to [b]
                               and no further. Yet, this is not the case.
